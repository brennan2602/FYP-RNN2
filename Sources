This project uses source code for the RNN from:

Google. c2019. Text generation with an RNN. [Online]. [4 January 2020].
Available from: https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/text/text_generation

Most of this code is reused with the primary difference being it is split across the rnnTrain and rnnGenerate classes

This project uses source code for MIDI to piano roll conversion, and piano roll to MIDI from:
Colin raffel. c2020. Pretty MIDI repository. [Online]. [4 January 2020].
Available from: https://github.com/craffel/pretty-midi

The get_piano_roll() and piano_roll_to_pretty_midi() functions are the extent of the usage of this source code,
the remainder of the code in the encode files were developed  by me.
